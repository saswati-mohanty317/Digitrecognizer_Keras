# Digitrecognizer_Keras
USing Keras to build a Neural network, to recognize Handwritten digits from a classic dataset of handwritten images that has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms..
Project results: 99.17% accuracy using 40 epochs, batch size of 60 and using 6 differnt layers of keras functions.
